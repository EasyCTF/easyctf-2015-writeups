# Plot Twist (20)

## Problem

We need to get the flag at [this](https://www.easyctf.com/static/problems/plot-twist/index.html) site. That shouldn't be too hard.

## Hint

There must be a backup on that site SOMEWHERE . . . you just have to look harder

## Writeup

Using inspect element, we look in the console and see the flag.

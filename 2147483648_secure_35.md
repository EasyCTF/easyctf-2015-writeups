# 2147483648% Secure (35)

## Problem

Hack my friend's [website](https://www.easyctf.com/static/problems/intro-js/index.html)! From what she tells me, it's super secure. Why don't we prove her wrong :)

## Hint

Don't try to figure out what the messy JavaScript code means. [Developer tools](https://www.google.com/search?q=developer+tools) help a lot in things like this.

## Writeup

Since `secret` is a global variable, you can just open the developer console and print the variable.

Alternatively, you could just look at the contents of `_0xa107`, which decodes to the flag.

## Flag

`easyctf{developer_console_is_your_friend}`

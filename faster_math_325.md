# Faster Math (325)

## Problem

I need help on my homework! Connect to `programming.easyctf.com:10300` where a series of 100 problems await you.

## Hint

There's only 4 types of problems. You can do it :) If you're having difficulty with the time limit, try running it on the shell server. Its internet should be pretty fast.

If you'd like, post your favorite, wackiest autogenerated problems to [@easyctf](http://twitter.com/easyctf)!

# Julius Save Me (20)

## Problem

This cipher involves shifty letters! `Cnebnl Vtxltk bl max uxlm unm fr ykbxgw ebdxl Gtihexhg uxmmxk yhk patmxoxk kxtlhg. Ha pxee. Max yetz bl xtlrvmy{Gti0exhg_ol_Vt3l4k}`

## Hint

You might want to read up on [Caesar ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher).

## Writeup

As the problem suggests, the text was encrypted using a caesar cipher. A quick google search leads us to [http://www.xarg.org/tools/caesar-cipher/](http://www.xarg.org/tools/caesar-cipher/).

Pasting the ciphertext in and setting the key to guess, we get

`Julius Caesar is the best but my friend likes Napoleon better for whatever reason. Oh well. The flag is easyctf{Nap0leon_vs_Ca3s4r}`

## Flag

`easyctf{Nap0leon_vs_Ca3s4r}`

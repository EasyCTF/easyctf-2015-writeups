# EasyCTF Day (55)

## Problem

EasyCTF started on November 3rd, 2015 this year. Find the position where the numerical representation of the month and day of this date `1103` is first found within pi. Use any language you'd like! The flag is the position of the first digit of the date within pi, where 3 is the first digit and the decimal point `.` is not considered a position.

## Hint

First you have to find a way to generate some digits of pi.

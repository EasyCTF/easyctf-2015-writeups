# Liar (50)

## Problem

I may or may not have illegally bought this [file](files/secret) from someone who claims that it contains secret pictures of my friend and her fianc√©. Unfortunately, I can't open it, and I already paid $4096 for it. Can you help me find out if the seller was lying?

## Hint

I feel like something is missing ...

Using hexdump (or opening up the file in a hex editor), we notice suspicious instances of PK, which is common to zip files.

`$ hexdump -C secret`

```

Unzipping the file, we get a new file with a `.png` extension. Unfortunately, the file seems broken. Opening it up in hexdump again, we notice `IHDR` at the beginning of the file and `IEND` at the end, indicating that it is indeed a PNG file.

`$ hexdump -C secret.png`

```
00000000  0d 0a 1a 0a 00 00 00 0d  49 48 44 52 00 00 0a 47  |........IHDR...G|

```

However, a quick look at the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics) page tells us that the file is lacking important information in the header, namely the first 4 bytes of the file signature.

In a hex editor, we prepend the bits `89 50 4e 47`, and reopen the image. This gives us the flag.

# Corrupted (375)

## Problem

I'm not an anime person, but I have weeaboo friends. One of them uses [this](files/yuno.jpg) as her profile pic. Unfortunately, she sent me a corrupted version. Can you find out what she's hiding?

## Hint

Who is Yuno Gasai? From what I hear, she's a scary yandere.

On a more serious note, stop trying to fix the image. It's not broken -- it's hiding stuff.

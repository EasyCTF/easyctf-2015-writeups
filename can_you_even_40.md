# Can You Even??? (40)

## Problem

Use the programming interface to complete this task. You&#39;ll be given a list of numbers.

Input: A list of numbers, separated by commas.

Output: The number of even numbers.

Read the input from a file called&nbsp;`can-you-even.in`&nbsp;that&#39;s in the current working directory, and then write your output to a file called&nbsp;`can-you-even.out`.

## Hint

If you need help, try looking at the Python Tutorial in the Learn section! Perhaps you should try looking into the modulo (%) operator.

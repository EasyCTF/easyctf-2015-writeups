# If Logic (30)

## Problem

Use the programming interface to complete this task. You&#39;ll be given a list of numbers.

Input: A list of numbers, separated by commas.

Output: Print `hi`if the number is 0-50 (inclusive), `hey` if the number is 51-100 (inclusive), and `hello` if anything else. Each greeting should have a linebreak after it.

Read the input from a file called&nbsp;`if-logic.in`&nbsp;that&#39;s in the current working directory, and then write your output to a file called&nbsp;`if-logic.out`.

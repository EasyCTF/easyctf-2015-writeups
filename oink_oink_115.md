# Oink Oink (115)

## Problem

Use the programming interface to solve this problem.

Now that we know how to convert from English to&nbsp;Pig Latin, can we reverse the translation? Given a sentence in Pig Latin, reverse it and try to find the original English text.

Be careful to note that if a Pig Latin word is capitalized, like &quot;Arispay&quot;, the original English word is &quot;Paris&quot; rather than &quot;pAris&quot;. Case counts!

ID: `piglatin2`

Input: A sentence in Pig Latin.

Output: The translation in English.

Read the input from a file called&nbsp;`piglatin2.in`&nbsp;that&#39;s in the current working directory, and then write your output to a file called&nbsp;`piglatin2.out`.

## Hint

Work backwards! You'll probably need the `chr()` and `ord()` functions! Also, string splicing is pretty cool in Python ;)

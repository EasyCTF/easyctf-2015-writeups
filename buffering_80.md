# Buffering (80)

## Problem

Can you overflow the stack? Try it at `/problems/overflow1` on the EasyCTF shell server. The source is available at `/problems/overflow1/overflow1.c`, and the program you're trying to overflow is at `/problems/overflow1/overflow1`. Good luck!

## Hint

Read a little bit about the stack [here](https://www.exploit-db.com/docs/28475.pdf).
